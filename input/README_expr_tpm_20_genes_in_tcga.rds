The file "expr_tpm_20_genes_in_tcga.rds" was generated using the following steps:

1) download the mRNA expression data from TCGAbiolinks with the following arguments: 
    project = "TCGA-BRCA"
    data.category = "Transcriptome Profiling"
    data.type = "Gene Expression Quantification"
    experimental.strategy = "RNA-Seq"
    workflow.type = "STAR - Counts"

2) extract the "TPM" data and turn it into a dataframe with columns {gene_name, gene_type, <TCGA barcodes ...>}
    
3) Filter to only include the 20 genes --> gene_name %in% c('CTLA4', 'LAG3', 'CD274', 'PDCD1', 'GZMA', 'PRF1', 'MEN1', 
                                                            'JUN', 'ARID1A', 'VHL', 'FBXW7', 'CASP3', 'NPM1', 'EGFR', 
                                                            'MYC', 'COX6C', 'HIF1A', 'TP53', 'ERBB2', 'AXIN2')

4) Filter TCGA barcodes to primary tumor samples

5) Convert TCGA barcodes to patient-id (TCGA-TSS-Participant)

6) Remove patient-ids with duplicated samples (if there is any)

7) Filter patient-ids to those included in the IGX analysis (refer to "tcga_all_datasets.rds")

8) Save this dataframe as an RDS object
